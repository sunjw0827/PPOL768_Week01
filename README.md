# PPOL768_Week01
This is a repository for PPOL768 week one assignment.

I'm a 2nd year MPP student. I began to learn STATA through my quant classes in McCourt. I could do basic explanatory data analysis with STATA. In my Quant 2 class, I could perform paper replication with STATA. I touched a little on GitHub through Intro to DS class but I am not very skilled at using the branch and merge tools via GitHub in group project. I haven't heard or learn anything about SurveyCTO before.

My policy interest is education policy. Through my quant 3 class, I learnt about methods on casual inference like RCT, RD and fixed-effect regression, I hoped to learn more detailed research design steps and strategies in this course.
